<h1>The Wild Wild West</h1>
<p>The wild wild west is a scary place for just any old partner. Only the roughest and the toughest cowboys can survive. One of the quickest draws ever seen was by a name of "Stone Cold" Billy. Billy only fought for the good of the people and <b>never</b> did them wrong. He was a hard working man.</b></p>
<h1>Indians</h1>
<p>The Indians are a  tough community built around family. They fight with bows and arrows.</p>
